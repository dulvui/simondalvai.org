## Stay up to date
Write me an email at [info@simondalvai.org](mailto:info@simondalvai.org?subject=Futsal%20Manager) or join my server on [Discord](https://discord.gg/a5DSHZKkA8), if you have questions about the game or simply want to stay up to date.  
Please keep in mind that I barely use Discord and prefer e-mails, but since so many people use Discord, I'll give it a shot.
So I might be slower to respond on Discord.
