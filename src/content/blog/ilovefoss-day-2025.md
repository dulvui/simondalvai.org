It's been a long time since I wanted to share a list of FOSS projects I really enjoy.
So this month's blog post will finally accomplish this desire.  
This list would be enormous if I would really cover every FOSS project I use.
To prevent that, I'll limit it to projects I use every day.

## MultiOS
This list covers projects that run on multiple operating systems.

### Lichess
The web can be full off ads, privacy invading trackers and proprietary software.
[Lichess](https://lichess.org) is the opposite of this all and offers free (as in free beer and free speech) online chess.
You can play it on Android, iOS and in the Web as an anonymous player or with an account. 
All features are available for free, even post-game evaluation with [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) in the cloud.

To support the project, you can [donate](https://lichess.org/patron) and [contribute](https://github.com/lichess-org).

### Syncthing
Since more than a year now I removed all my files and photos from the cloud and store them now locally at home.
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) made it really easy to synchronize files between different devices.

I works on many Operating systems such as Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android.
There seems to exist also an unofficial App for iOS.

To support the project, you can [donate](https://syncthing.net/donations/) and [contribute](https://github.com/syncthing/).

## Desktop
This list instead covers projects that run on Desktop.

### Debian
If you wonder what next Linux-distribution you could try, give Debian a shot.


### Godot

### Neovim

### Thunderbird

### KeepPassXC

## Android
Last but not least my favorite Android projects.

### GrapheneOS

### Unlauncher

### F-Droid

### AuroraStore

### K9Mail

### KeePassDX
