This are just the **bullet points** to my talk.
A video will be uploaded to YouTube a few days after the talk and the link will be added here.
When that happened, I will also extend every point with what I said during the talk.

Let's make some FOSS games!

## About me
**Childhood dreams** since [Nintendo Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy)

**2017** [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/), **3 mobile games** in **3 years**.  
- [ColorShooter](@/games/color-shooter/index.md)
- [Sn4ke](@/games/sn4ke/index.md)
- [WhatColor](@/games/whatcolor/index.md)

**2020** [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) **2 games** and working on **first FOSS commercial game**.  
- [Pocket Broomball](@/games/pocket-broomball/index.md)
- [Ball2Box](@/games/ball2box/index.md)
- [99 Managers Futsal Edition](@/games/99managers-futsal-edition/index.md) (still in beta)

Total of **6 games in 7 years** (2024) using a **2 different tools**.

## Problems with most games
Most players are **children**

**Ads and user tracking...**  
even without personal data [consent](https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/)

**Micro-transactions and loot boxes**  
[EU press release](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_831)
about **protecting children from harmful practices**

**Freemium games...**  
...where tiny fraction of players pay **thousands of Euros** per month

**Down the rabbit hole it can get alarming...**

## Game development job market
**My knowledge is based on web**

**Lower pay** than rest of industry

**High work hours** aka crunch time

**Working in games industry seen as a privilege**

**No jobs in South Tyrol**

**Remote really difficult**

## Why FOSS games
**Kiwi Free Software CD**

**FOSS games for future developers**

**Get quality feedback**

**Get contributions**

**Free access** to paid tools like [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/99-managers-futsal-edition/game/)

**Free access** to the game

**All problems** magically disappear

## Game engines
**2024 Unity introduces 0.20$ install fee** for games with over 1M downloads.

**List of game engines** on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines)

**Two main categories** libraries/frameworks and full engines  
...as [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) and [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

## Game distribution platforms
**F-Droid**

**Flathub**

**itch.io**

**Steam**

**Google Play Store**

**Apple App Store**

## FOSS business models
**No business, just fun**

**Donations**

**Sell desktop games platforms like Steam**  
with free versions on all other platforms  
like [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/), [game-stats.com](https://games-stats.com/steam/game/mindustry/)

## Guerilla marketing
**Write blog** if you like writing

**Or make videos**

**FOSS lists...**

[fossdroid](https://fossdroid.com/a/ball2box.html)  
[fossgaming](https://fossgaming.codeberg.page/games/pocket-broomball/)

**Niche games** bring natural visibility

## My game development advice
**Start with small games**

**Make web or desktop games**

**No gaming computer/laptop is needed**

**Participate in game jams**  
online on itch.io  
or offline like **castle game jam** or the **dung game jam**

## 99 Managers roadmap
**2025** release Futsal Edition on Steam and other platforms  
**2025** SFSCon talk proposal  
**2026** adapt code for other team sport  
**2027** and many other team sports  
**2030** ALL team sports ;-)  
...plans are made to be broken.
