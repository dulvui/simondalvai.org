I really love Free and Open Source Software.
Probably everybody with a working computing device uses FOSS everyday, and most of them, without knowing it.
I try to use it as much as I can, from the operating systems on my devices to the tools and apps I use.

Only many years later I realized, that I already took the first step down the hole.
