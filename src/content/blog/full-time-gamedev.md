I'm excited to announce that today is my first official day as a full time **indie game developer**. 
After three years of CI/CD pipelines, several software migrations and bug fixes at [NOI Techpark](https://noi.bz.it/en/), it was time to say goodbye.

## The plan
It was never my plan to become full time indie dev, because I thought that making games is just a hobby and a nice way to pass my free time.
But things have changed and my games became too complex to be developed properly in my limited free time.
So I had the feeling, that I need to try this adventure and see where it leads.

Now I can dedicate my whole day to my games, this blog and all the CI/CD pipelines I created for Godot and libGDX.
My main focus will be the game that got too big to handle in my free time, [Futsal Manager](https://simondalvai.org/games/futsal-manager/).
I plan to release the first early access on Steam and itch.io early 2025.
Having around half a year time, to finish my game, I feel that this date might actually be true this time.
(I've been promising to finish this game to my friends already too many times)

## The experiment
This whole "project" is actually an experiment, to see if I can make a living with **Free and Open Source games**.
I truly believe, that the game development world can profit from Open Source games.
There are already really nice Open Source game engines and libraries, like the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/).
I never used a closed source engine like Unity or similar, so I can't really compare them.
But the bad news Unity had in the past months, show that betting on a Open Source and community built engine, is the road to go.

I also believe that gamers will profit the most from Open Source games.
Being Open Source, limits the way one can profit from it, but in my opinion in a good way.
Business models like packing the game with ads or micro transactions don't really fit in the Open Source world.
Someone could simply make a copy of your game without ads, micro-transactions or a season pass.

## Making a living with FOSS games
There surely are and will be many other business models, that are FOSS compatible.
For now, I will simply follow the way [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io/) does it.
You can get free copies of the game on itch.io, flathub, F-Droid etc... and a payed version on Steam.  
This seems the easiest and safest way to do get some dollars out of a Open Source game.
It solves the cheaper clone of the game problem, because I will offer the cheapest (free) alternative on the market.

Surely this "business plan" is not compatible with big AAA game studios, but who knows, maybe some day we will see a AAA Open Source game.

## What comes next
Now you will hear much more from me, here in my blog and on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@dulvui).  
My git-steak (at the time of writing: over 1 year a commit a day) will continue and grow much bigger.
I'm also considering some live development streams on Twitch and videos on YouTube.
But for now, I will concentrate on finishing Futsal Manager.
