Also this year I had a talk at [SFSCON 2023](https://www.sfscon.it/) about F-Droid.  

## Abstract
On F-Droid you can find thousands of FOSS apps and games for Android.
F-Droid brings you visibility in the FOSS community that will provide great feedback, open issues and eventually contribute to your FOSS project.

This presentation is about my personal experience with my games Ball2Box, Pocket Broomball and Sn4ke published on F-Droid. I will show you what F-Droid is, how it works and the steps needed to submit your project.
