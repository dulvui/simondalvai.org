**[Wishlist now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3334770/99_Managers_Futsal_Edition/)**  
**[Play the beta on itch.io](https://simondalvai.itch.io/99managers-futsal-edition)**

## What teams/players will be in the game?
There will be **no real teams and players** in the game.
Fantasy teams and players will be generated by a script and will have random names and attributes.

The script works with a seed, to have always the same teams and players, if the same seed is used.
You might remember this from Minecraft, where the same seed mechanism is used for random world generation.

Having real teams and player names is a lot of work, legal headache and simply too much work for me alone.
An in-game editor could be a future solution to this problem.
With an in-game editor, you will be able to create your own players and possibly share the lists with others.
Another even simpler solution could be to simply add a csv import/export functionality.
This is on my to-do list, for the future.

## When will the game be available?
The game will be released 2025 and the exact date has still to be defined.
There is a **beta version** available on [itch.io](https://simondalvai.itch.io/99managers-futsal-edition).

I started working on the game on 11th July 2020 and a lot happened since then.
I migrated it from Godot 3.5 to 4, rewrote the Match engine several times and there is still much to do.
I worked only in my free time on this game, while having a full time job.
Since September 2024 I'm working full time on this game.

I do my very best to finish the game as soon as possible.

## Where can the game be played?
This will be my first Desktop game released on Steam.
So it will be available for **Linux**, **Windows** and **MacOS**.

For now no (official) mobile release is planned, since it is quite difficult to fit the content on small screens with touch support.
But once the game is released on Desktop, a mobile release might follow.

## How much will the game cost?
This might be my first game with a price, but I'm not sure how much.
I guess it will be between 5€ and 10€ on Steam, depending how the game will look and feel at first release.

The same game without modification will always be available for free on itch.io.
Once the beta period is over, the game will also be available for free on other platforms like flathub.org.

This game is Free and Open Source, under the [AGPL v3.0 or later](https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later) license.
That means that you are free to **study, modify, improve and share** the source code.
So technically you will always be able to build your own version of the game at no cost.
You just need the source code, the Godot Engine editor and some guide on how to build an executable, if you don't know already how to do that.
There will be a guide available in the repositories README, as soon the game is stable enough.

## This sounds great, can I help somehow?
Until the game is still in an unstable development phase, like now, I prefer to work alone on the game.
But as soon the game is in a stable state, you can contribute your ideas and especially **bug fixes**.

If you can't code, you still can help by **translating the game** to other languages.
There is a dedicated page on [weblate.org](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/99-managers-futsal-edition/),
where everybody can add new languages and improve existing translations.

And of course, you can also help me a lot by **spreading the word** about the game.
